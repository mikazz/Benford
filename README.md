## Main

* User input validation and protection
* The preferred form of asynchronous execution - a separate worker that could potentially work on another machine 
and some kind of communication system between them (e.g. through RabbitMQ or Redis).
* The solution should include automatic tests.
* Tests should be written in some test framework, e.g. built-in unittest or pytest, and should be run independently.
* Starting the microservice should be maximally automated (Docker).
